    padding (clamped to row 0 in the forward, matching the original torch.clamp+index_select).

                                              in practice -- skip rows get no input grad)

    # WHY THE GATHER COMPOSITION EXISTS: prepare() builds each stream's gather indices
    # against the PREVIOUS stream's output layout (current_locs_list chains), because the
    # sequential form never returns to an earlier stream. Interleaving does, so every
    # (stream, split) gather is re-anchored to the CANONICAL layout (features2card order --
    # the layout labels/probes index) by composing the chained permutations once per batch;
    # x then lives in canonical order the whole time, each layer-step doing
    # gather -> one layer -> scatter-back. Pad slots (-1) are dropped at scatter, never
    # written. This stays MODEL-side on purpose: prepare() runs in the fetch workers, and
    # touching it would change the batch stream (KD dump identity, byte-identical replays).
    #
    # v0 (the value-residual) is stream-local: each stream's round-0 layer has local
    # layer_id==0 and SETS v0 (the incoming empty tensor is ignored); it is stored per
    # (stream, split) in the STREAM'S layout and re-fed to that stream's later rounds --
    # identical threading to the sequential form, just spread across rounds.
